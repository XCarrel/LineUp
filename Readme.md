# Project LineUp

This is a simple project designed to explore some of the foundations of web development:

- PhP
- Javascript and JQuery
- Ajax
- CSS and SASS

The project stays intentionally away from frameworks and plugins. The idea is to reinvent the wheel ! Or better put: to understand why the wheel was invented.

The theme used is the management (in fact a simple CRUD) of the list of artists who will perform in a music festival.
